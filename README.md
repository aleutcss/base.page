# Page

The aleutcss `page` module is a very high-level module which styles very basic,
global, page-level aspects on the `html`-tag. It sets:
* Base font-size
* Base line-height
* Background and text-color
* Prevents  awkward ‘jumps’ when navigating between pages that do/do not have enough content to produce scrollbars naturally.
* Ensure the page always fills at least the entire height of the viewport
* Fixes text-rendering and font-bugs on some browsers.

## Install using npm:

```shell
    $ npm install --save-dev aleut-page
```
